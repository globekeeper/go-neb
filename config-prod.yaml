# Go-NEB Configuration File
#
# This file provides an alternative way to configure Go-NEB which does not involve HTTP APIs.
#
# This file can be supplied to go-neb by the environment variable `CONFIG_FILE=config.yaml`.
# It will force Go-NEB to operate in "config" mode. This means:
#   - Go-NEB will ONLY use the data contained inside this file.
#   - All of Go-NEB's /admin HTTP listeners will be disabled. You will be unable to add new services at runtime.
#   - The environment variable `DATABASE_URL` will be ignored and an in-memory database will be used instead.
#
# This file is broken down into 4 sections which matches the following HTTP APIs:
#   - /configureClient
#   - /configureAuthRealm
#   - /configureService
#   - /requestAuthSession (redirects not supported)

# The list of clients which Go-NEB is aware of.
# Delete or modify this list as appropriate.
# See the docs for /configureClient for the full list of options:
# https://matrix-org.github.io/go-neb/pkg/github.com/matrix-org/go-neb/api/index.html#ClientConfig
